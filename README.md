# Plant-Disease-Classification
It is used to classify plant categories based on the leaves of crops. Here I have used multinomial logistic regression for classification. The dataset for this problem is obtained from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset. It has 38 different classes to classify.
